Mode indicator
--------------

In the bottom left corner there is a mode indicator that shows what mode you are in currently.

Rebinding keys
--------------

You'll have to edit [keybinding.js](https://github.com/Wojnach/vimflowy/blob/master/keybindings.js) and [transparentKeybindings.js](https://github.com/Wojnach/vimflowy/blob/master/transparentKeybindings.js) if you want to rebind or add new shortcuts.

mac users: if you want to bind stuff to Cmd you'll have to type "meta-" instead. "meta-j" instead of "cmd-j" for example. 

Usage tips
----------

If you're using [cvim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh) (or any other Chrome extensions that install modal keybindings), make sure you add `http*://*.workflowy.com/*`to the excluded URLs.

Installation
------------

The extension is available on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimflowy/jhoonlfajlaihdlcocigbpeacapaepng)

But you can also download and install an unofficial version:
1. Clone this repo (or your fork) somewhere on your filesystem.
2. go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. click 'Load unpacked extension...' button right below 'Extensions' header in the top left corner of the page
4. point at the vimflowy repo directory
5. refresh workflowy page

Tested on
---------

The extension has mainly been tested on nordic QWERTY keyboards running windows 10, but it should work on other keyboard configurations as well. Please report any bugs you might find at [Issues](https://github.com/Wojnach/vimflowy/issues)
